#' Function to simulate gold standard negatives (GSN) given gold standard positives (GSP) and a gene network
#'
#' \code{xGSsimulator} is supposed to simulate gold standard negatives (GSN) given gold standard positives (GSP) and an input gene network. GSN targets are those after excluding GSP targets and their 1-order (by default) neighbors in the gene network.
#'
#' @param GSP a vector containing Gold Standard Positives (GSP)
#' @param population a vector containing population space in which gold standard negatives (GSN) will be considered. By default, it is NULL, meaning genes in the network will be used instead
#' @param network the built-in network. Currently two sources of network information are supported: the STRING database (version 10) and the Pathways Commons database (version 7). STRING is a meta-integration of undirect interactions from the functional aspect, while Pathways Commons mainly contains both undirect and direct interactions from the physical/pathway aspect. Both have scores to control the confidence of interactions. Therefore, the user can choose the different quality of the interactions. In STRING, "STRING_highest" indicates interactions with highest confidence (confidence scores>=900), "STRING_high" for interactions with high confidence (confidence scores>=700), "STRING_medium" for interactions with medium confidence (confidence scores>=400), and "STRING_low" for interactions with low confidence (confidence scores>=150). For undirect/physical interactions from Pathways Commons, "PCommonsUN_high" indicates undirect interactions with high confidence (supported with the PubMed references plus at least 2 different sources), "PCommonsUN_medium" for undirect interactions with medium confidence (supported with the PubMed references). By default, "STRING_medium" and "PCommonsUN_medium" are used
#' @param network.customised an object of class "igraph". By default, it is NULL. It is designed to allow the user analysing their customised network data that are not listed in the above argument 'network'. This customisation (if provided) has the high priority over built-in network
#' @param neighbor.order an integer giving the order of the neighborhood. By default, it is 1-order neighborhood
#' @param verbose logical to indicate whether the messages will be displayed in the screen. By default, it sets to true for display
#' @param RData.location the characters to tell the location of built-in RData files. See \code{\link{xRDataLoader}} for details
#' @param guid a valid (5-character) Global Unique IDentifier for an OSF project. See \code{\link{xRDataLoader}} for details
#' @return
#' a list with following components:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item{\code{GSN}: a vector containing simulated GSN}
#'  \item{\code{GSP}: a vector containing GSP after considering the population space}
#'  \item{\code{g}: an "igraph" object}
#' }
#' @note If multiple graphs are provided, they will be unionised for use.
